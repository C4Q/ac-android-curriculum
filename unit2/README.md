#Unit 2: Android Prework and Introduction

Congratulations on completing the assessment! We hope you enjoyed bootcamp.
In this prework assignment, you'll set up Android Studio and get your first
app up and running.

### Exercise

Watch all of the videos in Bitfountain's [Android Intro Course]
(https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLXWf1CYw-Lq0WyEh7uguXSUnh7SvzSESf).
Follow along with the videos to get Android Studio set up and run your
first Hello World app. An advantage of learning with a video is that you
can increase the speed and rewatch portions that you've already watched.


Here are some resources that might be helpful:
* [Android Studio](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html) - Download Android Studio here.
* [JDK 7](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/jdk7-downloads-1880260.html) -
this shouldn't be necessary, but in case you don't have JDK 7, you can download it here.
* [Intel HAXM](https://software.intel.com/en-us/android/articles/intel-hardware-accelerated-execution-manager) -
if you follow the videos you should be able to download this through the SDK manager, but if there are any problems you can download it here.
* [Building Your First App](http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/index.html) -
Different instructions from the official Android documentation.


If you have an Android device, then you can try [running the app on your phone]
(http://developer.android.com/training/basics/firstapp/running-app.html)!

If you don't, don't sweat it - there will be devices in class. See you then!
