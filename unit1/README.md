  - Command Line Git: clone, commit, pull, push
  - Branching and merging
  - GitHub pull request UX, how to converse on a PR
  - **Learning outcome**: Put simple personal site on GitHub, push to GitHub pages using GitBot.co
  - **Learning outcome**: Can talk shop about PRs, commits, branches, and sound informed in an interview setting

- Basics of Programming with Java

  - Traditional for, foreach, and while loops
  - How to think about the body of a loop as a "for each element"
  - **Learning outcome**: Able to print out interesting math sequences backwards and forwards using loops
- ArrayList: 1 Days

  - Pseudocode!
  - Loops & String Methods (Review)
  - Whiteboarding practice
  - Big O runtime analysis
  - Methods and refactoring
  Learning Outcome: Basic problem-solving flow going from understanding the prompt, generating pseudocode, and converting to code.


### Week 4
